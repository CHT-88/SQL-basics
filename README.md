# SQL-basics
This is the begginig of my SQL studies.
I will add definitions and very basic topics here to assist me with new concepts and fix my knowledge for the future.

Since I don't have an IT background, everything in this repo will be for absolute begginers.


**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used to facilitate retrieving specific information from databases.

**Database:** is a container (it can be a file or set of files) to store organized data.

**Table:** a structured list of data of a specific type.

**Schema:** information about database and table layout and properties.

**Datatype:** a type of allowed data. Every table column has an associated datatype that restricts (or allows) specific data in that column.

**Primary key:** a column (or set of columns) whose values uniquely identify every row in a table.
