# SQL-basics
This is the begginig of my SQL studies.
I will add definitions and very basic topics here to assist me with new concepts and fix my knowledge for the future.

Since I don't have an IT background, everything in this repo will be for absolute begginers.

**SQL (Structured Query Language):** is a domain-specific language used to facilitate retrieving specific information from databases.

**Database:** Is a container (it can be a file or set of files) to store organized data.
  
**RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):** .

**Table:** A structured list of data of a specific type.

**Schema:** Information about database and table layout and properties.

**Datatype:** A type of allowed data. Every table column has an associated datatype that restricts (or allows) specific data in that column.

**Primary key:** A column (or set of columns) whose values uniquely identify every row in a table.
